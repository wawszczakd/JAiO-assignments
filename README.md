# JAiO Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the course "Languages,
Automata Theory, and Theory of Computation".

## Overview

JAiO stands for "JÄ™zyki, Automaty i Obliczenia" in Polish, which translates to
"Languages, Automata Theory and Theory of Computation." This repository includes
my solutions to the assignments from this course. All the assignments and
solutions are written in Polish. The solutions are provided in PDF format and
were generated using LaTeX.

## Assignment Topics

The assignments cover the following topics:

1. Regular languages, finite-state machines (FSM)
2. Context-free languages, pushdown automata (PDA)
3. Turing Machines, decidability, semi-decidability, undecidability
4. Theory of Computation, P, NP, NP-hardness, NP-completeness

Please refer to the respective assignment directories for detailed solutions.
