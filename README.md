# JAiO Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the course "Languages,
Automata Theory, and Computation" (JAiO). JAiO focuses on the study of formal
languages, automata theory, and computation.

## Overview

JAiO stands for "JÄ™zyki, Automaty i Obliczenia" in Polish, which translates to
"Languages, Automata Theory and Computation." This repository includes my
solutions to the assignments from this course. All the assignments and solutions
are written in Polish. The solutions are provided in PDF format and were
generated using LaTeX.

## Assignment Topics

The assignments cover the following topics:

1. Regular languages, finite-state machines (FSM)
2. Context-free languages, pushdown automata (PDA)
3. Turing Machines, decidability, semi-decidability, undecidability

Please refer to the respective assignment directories for detailed solutions.
